# Live2DSprite

Easy-to-use Live2D Cubism 3 wrapper for cocos2d-x. This library is base on [Cubism Native Samples](https://github.com/Live2D/CubismNativeSamples), and inspired from Xrysnow's [cocos2d-x-live2d](https://github.com/Xrysnow/cocos2d-x-live2d).

Unlike other Live2D wrappers and Live2D official demo, Live2DSprite fully supports all cocos2d::Node interfaces, such as AnchorPoint, Rotation, BoundingBox, Color, Opacity and so on, it can also perform various cocos2d actions correctly.
